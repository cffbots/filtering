[AUTO] Add cffconvert GitHub action
Hello from the Generalization Team :raising_hand_man:
This is an automated Pull Request to add a [**CITATION.cff validator action**](https://github.com/citation-file-format/cffconvert-github-action).
We have verified that you have a \`CITATION.cff\` file and that you don't have an existing validator.
If you need more information, or think we made a mistake, please get in touch.
