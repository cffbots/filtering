Pull Request title: CITATION.cff fix and automatic validation of your citation metadata

Hello!

We noticed that your CITATION.cff had a small issue and fixed it - possibly by just updating `cffversion` to 1.2.0.

In addition to the fix, this Pull Request automates validation of that file using the [cffconvert GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/cffconvert). That way, it's a little bit easier to be robust against future changes to the `CITATION.cff` file.

BTW it's perfectly fine if you don't feel like accepting this Pull Request for whatever reason -- we just thought it might be helpful is all.

We found your repository using a partially automated workflow; if you have any questions about that, feel free to create an issue over at https://github.com/cffbots/filtering/issues/
